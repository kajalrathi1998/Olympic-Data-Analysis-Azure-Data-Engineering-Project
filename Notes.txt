first step:

create adf and adls resources in same resource grp

then create a config file for metadriven pipeline in which copy all the git urls from where the data should be taken
and upload this config csv to adls config container

and also create another container landingzone to save all the files read from git

next create linked services with http and adls on adf

for http:
baseurl: @{linkedService().url}
create a parameter url

for adls:
use same subscription it will automatically shows

next create dataset:
http_ds in this use http linked service 
create adls_source_ds using adls linked service (select path to config)
and create adls_sink_ds using adls likned service (select path to landing)


create a datadriven pipeline
activity lookup:
under setting:
adls_source_ds and wildcard file path

activity foreach:
under settings:
@activity('Lookup1').output.value
under activities:
copy data 

activity copydata:
source: http_ds, open create a parameter url_name and in connection give value as @dataset().url_name and then in pipeline item().url
sink: adls_sink_ds, open, create a parameter url_name and in connection under filepath -> @last(split(dataset().url_name,'/'))
and in pipeline @item().url

validate -> publish -> debug
and check adls landing if file came or not
